# About
The MIUA conference is a premier UK-based conference in medical imaging, organized and supported by the [British Machine Vision Association](https://www.bmva.org/). MIUA is the principal UK forum for communicating research progress within the community interested in image analysis applied to medicine and related biological science. The meeting is designed for the dissemination and discussion of research in medical image understanding and analysis, and aims to encourage the growth and raise the profile of this multi-disciplinary field by bringing together the various communities. 

The proceedings of the MIUA conference are published in the Springer LNCS series (a well-known series).

The special session on AI in surgery aims to explore and identify key areas for rapid developments in AI for surgical care, encompassing its potential, diverse applications, and the practical challenges that lie ahead in integrating AI tools into clinical procedures. The session will bring together domain experts from computer science and clinical surgery to facilitate cross-disciplinary dialogue and share new and existing methods in AI for different surgical procedures. Participants will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and build collaborations that will leave a lasting impact on both research and clinical practice in Surgical AI.
