Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to transform healthcare with applications in disease diagnosis, prognosis, personalized medicine, and education. The surgical landscape is poised to benefit significantly in terms of precision, accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. The applications of AI in optimizing surgical care extend to the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases. This will be relevant to all surgical specialities: neurosurgery, cardiothoracic, gastrointestinal, sarcoma, orthopaedic, plastic and vascular surgery. These include enabling telesurgery procedures, improving surgical navigation, and advancing surgical image and video analysis. Furthermore, AI demonstrates immense potential in transforming surgical education and training through enhanced video analysis, advanced surgical simulations, and robust skills assessment tools. As a result, there is growing interest in developing and implementing AI-based tools and methods in surgical care.

This special session aims to explore and identify key areas for rapid developments in AI for all types of surgical care (robotic, minimal access and open), encompassing its potential, diverse applications, and the practical challenges that lie ahead in integrating AI tools into clinical procedures. The session will bring together domain experts from computer science and clinical surgery to facilitate cross-disciplinary dialogue and share new and existing methods in AI for different surgical procedures. Participants will have the opportunity to exchange ideas and build collaborations that will leave a lasting impact on both research and clinical practice in Surgical AI.

The scope of this special session includes a wide range of topics related to AI in surgical care. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

### Data and Model Development
